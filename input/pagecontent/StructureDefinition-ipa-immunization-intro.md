<!-- Boilerplate -->
The following data elements must always be present (in other words, mandatory resource properties where the minimum cardinality is 1) or must be supported ([Must Support](conformance.html#must-support-and-obligations) definition). Servers cannot restrict access to mandatory elements when authorizing an application. However, servers may choose to provide additional information or may be required to do so by national or other profiles that apply to the server's context.
