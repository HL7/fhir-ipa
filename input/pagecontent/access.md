An applicationÂ <span class="bg-success" markdown="1">is</span><!-- new-content --> authorized to access a patient record using the [SMART App Launch Protocol](http://hl7.org/fhir/smart-app-launch/)'s standalone launch sequence. See the <span class="bg-success" markdown="1">required server and client</span><!-- new-content --> SMART on FHIR capabilities on the [security page](security.html). <span class="bg-success" markdown="1">The use of SMART on FHIR is described below.</span><!-- new-content -->

### Client Process

A client application gets access to a patient record by following this general sequence of steps:


<div class="bg-success" markdown="1">
* Register itself as a client application with the endpoint. 
  * This may require a manual step on the part of the user or the developer, or the endpoint may support automatic registration (see [OAuth 2.0 Dynamic Client Registration Protocol](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7591)). 
  * if the application supports automatic registration, the endpoint will be specified in the [url]/.well-known/smart-configuration
  * Note that most healthcare systems exercise control over which clients can access healthcare records, and automatic registration is not supported.
</div><!-- new-content -->

* <span class="bg-success" markdown="1">Identifying the appropriate end point [URL] at which the IPA-compatible API is found.</span><!-- new-content -->
  * Note that this specification does not specify how the endpoint might be found; different countries will have different arrangements around this. 

* Fetch the system capability statement from [url]/metadata and check that [it implements the IPA API](conformance.html)

* Fetch the [endpoint configuration](https://hl7.org/fhir/smart-app-launch/conformance.html#using-well-known) from [url]/.well-known/smart-configuration. 

* Follow the [Smart App Launch Protocol](http://www.hl7.org/fhir/smart-app-launch/app-launch.html#step-2-launch-standalone) using the authorization endpoint from the smart-configuration file and request the `launch/patient` scope. 

* At the end of the SMART App Launch Protocol, the application will have a token that provides access to a single patient record. Now, use that to [retrieve patient information](fetching.html).

### Scopes

<div class="bg-success" markdown="1">
Scopes work as described in the SMART on FHIR specification. Servers **MAY** limit clients' scopes to those configured at registration time. Servers **SHOULD** allow users to select a subset of the requested scopes at the approval time. The app **SHOULD** inspect the returned scopes and accommodate the differences from the scopes it requested and registered.
</div><!-- new-content -->

### SMART on FHIR Obligations and Capabilities:

IPA conformant servers SHALL support:

 - the resources as profiled by IPA to represent clinical information (Profile Support) and <span class="bg-success" markdown="1">[the RESTful FHIR API](http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/http.html)</span><!-- new-content --> interactions defined for it (Interaction Support)
 - the SMART on FHIR obligations and capabilities

This section documents the SMART on FHIR obligations and capabilities. Support for IPA Profiles and their FHIR Interactions are documented on the [Conformance](conformance.html) page.

#### SMART on FHIR Server Obligations
 
* The server hosts a [smart-configuration file](http://www.hl7.org/fhir/smart-app-launch/conformance.html#using-well-known) at [url]/.well-known/smart-configuration  that is available to both authenticated and unauthenticated clients.
* Specific obligations for server support of SMART on FHIR capabilities are defined below, and include the server hosting a smart-configuration file at [url]/.well-known/smart-configuration that is available to both authenticated and unauthenticated clients.


<div class="bg-success" markdown="1">

#### SMART on FHIR Server Capabilities

Servers SHALL support the following [SMART on FHIR capabilities](http://hl7.org/fhir/smart-app-launch/conformance.html#capabilities):

 * [launch-standalone]
 * [context-standalone-patient]
 * [permission-patient]
 * [permission-offline]
 * [sso-openid-connect]
 * [client-public]
 * [client-confidential-asymmetric]


 Servers MAY support the other SMART on FHIR capabilities, such as:
 * [launch-ehr]
 * [context-ehr-patient]
 * [permission-user]
 * [client-confidential-symmetric]

#### SMART on FHIR Client Capabilities

Client apps will need to support a subset of the SMART on FHIR server capabilities to function:

- SHALL support [launch-standalone] or [launch-ehr] or both.
-  SHOULD support [launch-standalone] and MAY support [launch-ehr].
- Patient-facing apps SHALL support [context-standalone-patient] and SHOULD support [permission-patient].
- Apps with the technical capability to keep a secret SHALL support [client-confidential-asymmetric] and MAY support [permission-offline].
- Apps without the technical capability to keep a secret SHALL support [client-public] and SHALL NOT support [client-confidential-asymmetric].

#### SMART on FHIR Server Process

The  steps described below are generally performed when a server grants access to a client -- 
* The server conforms to the SMART App Launch specification, and checks that the authenticated user of the application has access.
*  If the client requests access to a patient record, the server checks that the authenticated user of the application has access to the specified record.
*  If the authenticated user is authorized to access multiple patient records, the server typically requires that the user choose a single patient record to share. (A patient often has access to multiple records in the case of a parent or family caregiver).
*  The server ensures that the authenticated user has access to the record being shared.
*  The server returns a Patient FHIR resource identifier as the patient SMART launch context parameter when authorization is granted and includes any patient/ scopes, as defined by the SMART App Launch Protocol.
