Note that the base FHIR specification defines a profile on the Observation resource used to specifically represent vitals signs. To adhere to IPA as well as the base FHIR specifications, implementers SHALL support the [FHIR Core Vitals Signs profile](http://hl7.org/fhir/us/core/2017Jan/StructureDefinition-us-core-vitalsigns.html). 

The IPA-Observation profile defined here SHALL be used to represent Observations other than vital signs.
