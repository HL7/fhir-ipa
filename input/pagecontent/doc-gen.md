A patient's record may contain any number and type of documents, from interoperable C-CDA documents to binary PDFs. The `$docref` operation returns DocumentReference resources describing these existing documents, but can also cause a document to be newly generated and returned. 

See the [$docref operation](OperationDefinition-docref.html) for the details.
