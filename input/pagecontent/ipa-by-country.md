### Country specific implementations of IPA 

The following FHIR implementation guides are consistent with IPA

* [US Core](http://hl7.org/fhir/us/core)
* [Argonaut Specification](https://build.fhir.org/ig/argonautproject/R4) (draft)
* [Australian Argonaut](https://build.fhir.org/ig/hl7au/argonaut-au/) (draft)

Note that all these guides make additional rules about access and content to meet other use cases,
but these rules are consistent with this specification.
