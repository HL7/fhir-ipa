# Country specific implementations of IPA 

The following FHIR implementation guides are consistent with IPA

* [US Core](http://hl7.org/fhir/us/core)
* [Argonaut Specification](https://build.fhir.org/ig/argonautproject/R4) (draft)
* [Australian Argonaut](https://build.fhir.org/ig/hl7au/argonaut-au/) (draft)

Note that all these guides make additional rules about access and content to meet other use cases,
but these rules are consistent with this specification.

Note also that not all implementations of these implementation guides are conformant to this 
specification. In particular, this specification makes specific rules around language, timezone,
and how patient merge is handled that are not required by some or all of these specifications.
