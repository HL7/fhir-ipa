# Versions of SMART beyond SMARTv2.0.0 specify behavior that is not widely implemented. This is intentional.
WARNING: ImplementationGuide/hl7.fhir.uv.ipa: ImplementationGuide.dependsOn[2]: The ImplementationGuide uses package hl7.fhir.uv.smart-app-launch#2.0.0 released on 2021-11-26, but the most recent version is 2.2.0. This reference is getting old and the more recent version should be considered

# QA error began appearing well into the publication process, well after IG was approved for publication by the various, multiple HL7 committees.
