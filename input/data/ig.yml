description: This IG  describes how an application acting on behalf of a patient can
  access information about the patient from an clinical records system using a FHIR
  based API. The clinical records system may be supporting a clinical care provider
  (e.g. a hospital, or a general practitioner), or a health data exchange, including
  a national health record system.

    description: This  CapabilityStatement describes the basic rules for the International
      Patient Access client actor that initiates a data access request to and retrieves
      patient data from an IPA Responder. In addition, it lists the client conformance
      expectations for each resource type documented in IPA. These expectations include
      supported FHIR profiles, RESTful operations, and search parameters. International
      Patient Access clients define their capabilities by choosing from this list
      based on the resource types they need to access.

    description: "This operation is used to return all the references to documents\
      \ related to a\npatient. It is invoked on a FHIR Server's DocumentReference\
      \ endpoint (e.g., `[base]/DocumentReference/$docref`) and operates across all\
      \ DocumentReference instances. \n\n The operation requires a patient id and\
      \ takes the optional input parameters: \n  - start date\n  - end date\n  - document\
      \ type \n  - on-demand\n  - profile  \n\nand returns a *searchset* [Bundle](http://hl7.org/fhir/bundle.html)\
      \ containing [DocumentReference](StructureDefinition-ipa-documentreference.html)\
      \ resources for the patient. If the server has stored documents or can create\
      \ documents for the patient and those documents are available for the user,\
      \ the server returns the DocumentReference resources associated with documents.\
      \ This operation's intended use is to provide a way for providers or patients\
      \ to access their available documents. The document itself can be subsequently\
      \ retrieved using the link provided  in the `DocumentReference.content.attachment.url\
      \ element`. The link could be a FHIR endpoint to a [Binary](http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/binary.html)\
      \ Resource or some other document repository. \n\nThis operation is *different*\
      \ from a FHIR RESTful query on DocumentReference by patient and type and date\
      \ range because: \n\n1. It is used to request a server to *generate* a document\
      \ based on the specified parameters.\n\n1. If no parameters are specified, the\
      \ server SHALL return a DocumentReference to the patient's most current summary\
      \ document. The type of such summary document will depend on jurisdiction. For\
      \ example, it may be a C-CDA CCD. It is expected that such a summary document\
      \ will always exist or can be dynamically generated; however, a jurisdiction\
      \ may define the outcome of the operation when such a document is missing.\n\
      \n1. If the server cannot *generate* a document based on the specified parameters,\
      \ the operation will return an empty search bundle.\n\nUnless the client indicates\
      \ they are only interested in 'on-demand' documents using the *on-demand* parameter,\
      \ the server SHOULD return DocumentReference instances for *existing* documents\
      \ that meet the request parameters  In this regard, this operation is *similar*\
      \ to a FHIR RESTful query."
