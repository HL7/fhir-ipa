Accessing Patient records raises many questions about safety. For example, accessing the wrong patient records, missing correct records, displaying records incorrectly, or having non-authorized actors access records can harm patients. The [Implementer Safety Checklist page](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/safety.html) gathers clinical safety advice acquired from experience of accessing health records across
FHIR APIs like this one. All implementers should carefully consider each of the items on the checklist  Getting these issues right is necessary but insufficient to deliver safe patient applications.

Note that software can misinterpret health care records which can also lead to dire consequences. However, this specification does not provide enough information about accessing records to support interpreting the content. Implementers must consult their country-specific guides for this.
